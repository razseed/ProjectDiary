<p>
  Client wants a new webpage/pages for their blog found at www.DiaryOfDifference.com 
  after speaking with the client there are several features requested for the page. 
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Recycle content in an organic way.</li>
  <li>Read more buttons/links for full pages.</li>
  <li>Redevelop the nav bar, to encompass transitions.</li>
  <li>Space baked into the layout for unobtrusive advertising.</li>
  <li>Mobile, Screenreader and laptop compatability.</li>
  <li>Branding, make the brand defined.</li>
 </ol>

<p>
  List item number one will be a real challange, finding a way to programme the site to 
  constantly update on refresh with a new piece of yet unseen to the viewer content 
  written at some time in the past, this blog currently has terrible accessibilty in 
  the sense that old content is simply buried unless keyword searched for from, google 
  as an example.
