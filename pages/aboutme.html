        <p>Hello and welcome to my blog!</p>
        <p>my name is Ivana and I live in England, UK</p>
        <p> I was born in Skopje, Macedonia, but I moved to the UK in 2016</p>
        <p>A little bit about me, apart from my extreme passion for books,
            I also love sending postcards, playing video games,<br> taking photographs
            and enjoying my hot chocolate.
            I used to be a national karate champion of Macedonia for 8 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favourite genres are: mystery (psychological thrillers are my
            ultimate favorites),<br> young-adult, contemporary, romance. 
            I also tend to read a little bit of everything and keep exploring new genres.  
        </p>
        <p>
            You can find me online on all social media platforms. 
            If you are there too, come and say hi to me <br> I love talking,
            meeting new people, and I especially love reading your posts.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spend a lot of time and effort into my blog,
            and I review books for free.<br>
            If you want to encourage me to keep posting amazing content and upgrade my blog,
            you can do that by buying me a coffee:
