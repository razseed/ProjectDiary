  <h1>The Devouring Gray by Christine Lynn Herman<br>Book Review</h1>
 <div class="topSectionBackground">
  <h2>Initial impressions:</h2><p class="impressions">The Devouring Gray has a very gripping introduction.
      I love a trope when a new person comes to town. And add to this a small town with founding families that all keep secrets.
      Very creepy small town setting and danger looming. I loved this book and can't wait for the next one.

        <p>
            After the death of her sister, seventeen-year-old Violet Saunders finds herself dragged to
            Four paths, New York. Violet may be a newcomer, but she soon learns her mother isn't:
            They belong to one of the revered founding families in the town, where stone bells hang above every doorway
            and danger lurks in the depths of the woods.<br><br>
            
            Justin Hawthornes bloodline has protected Four Paths for generations from the Gray- A lifeless dimension that 
            imprisons a brutal monster. After justin fails to inherit his familie's powers,
            his mother is determined to keep this humiliation a secret. But Justin can't let go
            of the future he was promised and the town he swore to protect.<br><br>
            
            Ever since Harper Carlisle lost her hand to an accident that left her stranded in the Gray
            for days, she has vowed revenge on the person who abandoned her: Justin Hawthorne.
            There are ripples of dissent in Four Paths,
            and Harper seizes an opportunity to take down the Hawthornes and change her destiny-to what
            extent, even she does'nt yet know.<br><br>
            
            The Gray is growing stronger every day, and its victims are piling up.
            When Violet accidentally unleashes the monster, all three must band together
            with the other Founders to unearth the dark truths behind their familie's abilities—before
            the Gray devours them all.

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>t was so easy for me to get sucked into the story.
     Even though we have four founding families with a lot of characters and different histories,
     it was'nt too hard to understand how they all fit into the story as a whole.
     If you have read “We Were Liars” by E. Lockhart,
     you can feel the same vibe from this book too. The adventures of the group,
     their personal stories, secrets and battles.
     Their eagerness to defeat the status quo and the Gray.</p>

                   "She thought about heroes, villians, legends and monsters. And decided that whoever
                   told the story was more powerfull than all of them."

    Without spoiling anything, the danger that looms over this town is unique.
    There is a strangeness and an eeriness. The spookiness that an episode of “Stranger Things”
    can bring. And in this whole world, where things are very real, but they seem very unreal,
    we have our main characters. They make this fictional town seem very real.
    They make us readers believe this is the normal, and I believed them throughout the book.
    The family roots and history tales, the power and responsibility they carry.
    Their bravery to fight something they know is very dangerous.   
</p>
<p>
    Violet was my first favourite character. But very shortly after she arrived,
     Harper because the queen in my eyes. And then all of them, every single one of them.
      Now, I am most intrigued by Isaac. But maybe because his story is not told in full.
       He’s yet to share the full tale and when he does, I’ll be here for it.

    The Devouring Gray is that YA fantasy thriller that you’ve been waiting for.
    It will give you the chills and the feels. 
    New girl comes in town with a mystery town eerie twist is something that should intrigue anyone.
    I will be eagerly waiting for book 2.
